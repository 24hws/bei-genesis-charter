## I. Prologue — The Genesis of a Human-Centric Science
The conceptual lineage of the discipline traces back to **1999**, with a complete system and charter formalized in 2025.  

Throughout human history, every leap of civilization began with one realization: we can comprehend the universe, yet we have not fully understood ourselves. Physics revealed the structure of matter; economics quantified the flow of resources; but **human identity**—the source of behavior and value—has not been systematically defined or standardized.  
**BEI Genesis Science** emerges not as an extension of existing fields but as a **new scientific layer**, unifying behavior, identity, value, and sovereignty within a measurable, verifiable, and operational framework.  
This discipline is represented by **BEIGenesis.com / .org** and **BEIScience.com / .org**—“**BEIGenesis**” embodies creation, “**BEIScience**” sustains evolution.

## II. Foundational Principles — From Behavior to Identity to Economy
**Core principle:** every action generates a verifiable **behavioral identity instance** and binds to a principal **BEI-ID**, forming a computable **economic identity graph**.

- **Behavior** → generator of identity  
- **Identity** → extension of behavior  
- **Economy** → reflection of behavioral value

### Dual Foundations
**Ethical Minimum** (moral boundary): only the minimum necessary exposure and intervention are allowed in any act, authorization, or transaction.  
1) Authorization **revocable**  
2) Data **auditable**  
3) Operations **reversible** (due-process rollback)  
4) No violation of **human sovereignty or dignity**

**Capability Minimum** (fairness baseline): any person, nation, or community—regardless of capital or technical resources—must be able to participate in BEI and own a sovereign identity.  
BEI thus takes the Ethical Minimum as its moral foundation and the Capability Minimum as its fairness foundation.

## III. Scientific Definition
**BEI Genesis Science** is a scientific discipline that **standardizes human behavioral evidence into sovereign economic identities**, built upon ethical and capability minima, combining conformance agreements and reversible authorization so that identity, behavior, and value are **verifiable, tradable, and governable** across domains.

**Core technologies:**  
- **BEIDID** (Decentralized Identity)  
- **BEISIGN** (Dual-Signature / reversible authorization)  
- **BEICX** (Sovereign clearing)  
- **BEI-SEP / BEI-STD** (standards & standard-essential patents)

## IV. Scope and Universality
BEI connects **finance, medicine, education, governance, culture, and technology** into a unified framework centered on behavioral identity. Individuals, families, and nations can participate in the global economy with verifiable identity—**creating credit through behavior and realizing sovereignty through identity**.

## V. Ethical Foundation and Sovereign Architecture
The architecture is governed by the **Ω-Governor (Omega Governor)**—the meta-sovereign layer for ethical oversight, cross-sovereign coordination, authorization auditing, rollback adjudication, and civilizational supervision.  
The Ω-Governor is maintained by **BEI Foundation** (BEIGOV.com / .org) and represented legally via **BEIGovernor.com / .org**, ensuring coherence and traceability across ethical, legal, and sovereign dimensions.

## VI. Technological Embodiment and Standardization
BEI Genesis Science is operational:  
- **BEICX** (global clearing network)  
- **BEISIGN** (behavioral authorization stack)  
- **BEIINDEX / BEICREDIT** (behavioral credit mapping)  
- **BEIMINT** (behavior-to-value conversion)  
- **BEILEDGER** (sovereign ledger)  
- Domain modules: **BEIMED**, **BEIEDU**, **BEISTATE**

All follow **BEI-STD** and **BEI-SEP**, constituting the **BEI-SES (Standard Essential System)**—a licensable, tradable, verifiable framework that unites **BEI-STD, BEI-SEP, and BEI-SPEC**.

## VII. Purpose — A Civilizational Operating System
BEI is **an operating system for civilization**. It enables 8.3 billion people to act as sovereign participants—each with verifiable identity, quantifiable behavior, and convertible value—where **identity is value, behavior is currency, and ethics is law**.

## VIII. Declaration
When human identity is governed scientifically and ethically, it becomes fundamental infrastructure for civilization, marking the emergence of a new scientific era where **sovereignty, economy, and identity are unified**.

## IX. Conclusion and Patent Foundation
The Charter is maintained by **BEI Foundation (California)** and **ATMSPAC Inc (Delaware)**, in cooperation with **BEIGX Inc, HealthSPAC Inc, BEI.app, and ATMS.com**.
